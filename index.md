I'm a postdoctoral researcher, currently based at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Norway in the group of Prof. Jon Wright. My work focuses predominantly on the interactions between parents and offspring, and especially on the causes and consequence of variation in parental investment in birds. I am also interested in statistical methodology, such as mixed effects (or hierarchical) models, quantitative genetic modelling, comparative analysis and meta-analysis.
