I am an Evolutionary Ecologist, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, UK in the group of Prof. Loeske Kruuk. 

My work focuses predominantly on the interactions between parents and offspring, and especially on the causes and consequence of variation in parental investment in birds. Recently I have become interested in integrating theory and methods from behavioural ecology, quantitative genetics and demography to understand how social interactions impact upon population dynamics.

I am also interested in understanding and developing statistical methodology, predominantly mixed-effects effects (or hierarchical) models.
