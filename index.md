I am an Quantitative Ecologist, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Edinburgh, UK in the group of Prof. Loeske Kruuk. 

Broadly, my work focuses on understanding how ecological and evolutionary processes interact to affect short term population dynamics. 
In particular, I am interested in how social interactions (for example, those between parents and offspring, siblings, and the competition for resources driven by population density) affect selection and inheritance and how we measure them. As these evolutionary processes scale up to affect population dynamics, Understanding them can help us to better understand population stability and the potential for population recovery through evolutionary rescue.

This work requires integrating theory and methods from behavioural ecology, quantitative genetics and population ecology to understand how social interactions impact upon population dynamics.

I am also interested in understanding, developing and teaching statistical methodology, predominantly mixed-effects effects (or hierarchical) models.
