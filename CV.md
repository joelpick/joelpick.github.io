## About Me

Originally I'm from the UK. I did my undergraduate and masters at the University of Sheffield, with Ben Hatchwell, before moving to Zurich to do my PhD in the group of Barbara Tschirren. I was then awarded an early mobility fellowship by the Swiss National Science Foundation, to go and work with Shinichi Nakagawa at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. I am now based at the University of Edinburgh, UK, working in the group of Jarrod Hadfield.
