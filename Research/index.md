**Parental Care**
In many taxa, parents provide a huge amount of resources to their offspring, prenatally through eggs and seeds and postnatally through provisioning their offspring. My work seeks to disentangle the impact that this care has on offspring, and determine whether this care is costly for the parents.  

**Evolutionary Stasis**
In the wild, many traits have been shown to be under strong selection and have a genetic basis. Quantitative genetic theory would predict that such traits should rapidly evolve, but typically we do not see this - a phenomenon known as the paradox of stasis. I am interested in exploring why we don't see the trait evolution we expect, focussing on juvenile body size.

**Egg Morphology**
Eggs represent a package of prenatal maternal investment, containing everything a embryo needs to develop. There is remarkable variation in size and shape, both between and within species. I am fascinated in understanding the causes and consequences of this variation within bird populations.

**Statistical Methodology**
