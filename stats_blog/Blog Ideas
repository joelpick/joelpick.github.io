# The eternal question: fixed or random
## Common answers
- fixed = you care about it, random = you want to control for it
- its part of the design
- fixed number of levels

## My take
- are you interested in the specific levels, and testing between them
- are you interested in a variance
- how much replication do you have within levels - i.e. will shrinkage give you better estimates

-deals better with unbalanced designs?

## Univariate

### Fixed effects

### Random effects

#### Parameter Expanded Priors


### Binary data
Fix residual variance to one


## Multivariate
